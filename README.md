# Hydroponic Tower

A vertical hydroponic growing system for efficient space utilization and optimized plant growth.

## Overview

This hydroponic tower system allows you to grow plants vertically, maximizing space while providing optimal nutrient delivery and environmental control.

## Features

- Vertical tower design for space efficiency
- Automated nutrient delivery system
- Environmental monitoring and control
- Modular construction for easy expansion

## Nutrient Supply

### Terra Aquatica TriPart Fertilizer System

This system uses the Terra Aquatica TriPart fertilizer system, a comprehensive three-part nutrient solution designed for hydroponic growing:

- **TriPart Grow**: Provides nitrogen and potassium for structural and vegetative growth
- **TriPart Bloom**: Promotes flowering and fruiting with phosphorus and potassium
- **TriPart Micro**: Delivers essential micro and secondary nutrients

The TriPart system offers flexibility to adjust nutrient ratios throughout different growth stages, ensuring optimal plant development from seedling to harvest.

## Setup

1. Assemble the tower structure
2. Install the water pump and nutrient reservoir
3. Connect the irrigation system
4. Set up environmental sensors
5. Configure the nutrient delivery schedule

## Maintenance

- Monitor pH levels (optimal range: 5.5-6.5)
- Check EC/TDS levels regularly
- Clean the system monthly to prevent algae buildup
- Inspect pumps and tubing for proper operation
